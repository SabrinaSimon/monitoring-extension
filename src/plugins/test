Generic Handshake Interface
A unified contract (PluginInterface) with flexible config (Record<string, any>) enabling consistent communication across all monitoring plugins.

Dynamic Plugin Management
The PluginManager dynamically registers, initializes, and manages multiple plugins based on user configuration â€” supporting extensibility.

Secure VS Code Settings Integration
Plugin configurations are stored and managed securely within VS Code settings, avoiding file system dependencies or security risks.

Extensible Plugin Implementations
Easily add new monitoring tools (e.g., Grafana, Kibana) by implementing the generic interface without changing core extension logic.

User-Driven Configuration UI
Users can interactively configure plugins via VS Code commands and input prompts, streamlining setup without manual config file edits.
